# Golf Score Keeper

## About
Stumbled upon this project in a USB drive that I developed when I was 16 years old. It was my biggest project at the time and exercised
GUI, object oriented, and binary I/O programming. My dad is a casual golf player and created this app for his birthday (but he
never uses it...).

## Features
* Save golf course information (the par of each hole)
* Save scores for each hole during a session
* All golf course and session information encrypted in binary file (file.dat)
* Edit and save information at any time

## Prerequisites
* Windows, other OS not guarenteed
* JRE 8, other versions not guarenteed

## Quickstart
Just run main.jar

## Limitations
I'm not a golf player myself, but I remember my dad would usually handwrite his scores. I would imagine that manually inputting the 
score for 18 holes is a tedious and unnecessary process. Additionally, the interface is simply not pretty enough.
